# Quarto-game
Originally developed by Mihail Maximov at mihailmaximov.ru
Implemented by me for practice


The rules of the Quarto game: there are 16 figures that differ from each other in four ways. The task of each player is to be the first to collect a number of figures vertically, horizontally or diagonally with some common feature. Opponents select the figure to be moved for each other.
